# Test Report for Modal Size and Calendar Printing Fixes

## 1. Modal Size Consistency Fix

### Changes Made:
- **QuickBookingModal.tsx**: 
  - Changed from `max-w-7xl` to `max-w-4xl`
  - Removed `transform scale-[0.8]` 
  - Changed height from `h-[95vh]` to `h-[90vh]`

- **EditBookingModal.tsx**: 
  - Changed from `max-w-7xl` to `max-w-4xl`
  - Removed `transform scale-[0.8]`
  - Changed height from `h-[95vh]` to `h-[90vh]`

- **BookingModal.tsx**: 
  - Changed from `max-w-2xl` to `max-w-4xl`
  - Kept height at `max-h-[90vh]`

### Expected Result:
All three modals should now have the same width (`max-w-4xl`) and similar heights, appearing consistent regardless of how they are triggered.

### Test Steps:
1. Click the "+" button to open QuickBookingModal
2. Click on an existing booking to open EditBookingModal
3. Open BookingModal (if used elsewhere)
4. Compare the sizes - they should all be consistent

## 2. Calendar Printing Fix

### Changes Made:
- **BookingTableExport.tsx**: 
  - Added calendar-specific print styles in `@media print` block
  - Implemented DOM cloning for calendar elements
  - Set page orientation to landscape for calendar printing

- **CalendarMonth.tsx**: 
  - Added semantic CSS classes: `calendar-month`, `calendar-grid`, `calendar-day`, `calendar-event`

- **CalendarWeek.tsx**: 
  - Added semantic CSS classes: `calendar-week`, `calendar-grid`, `calendar-day`, `calendar-event`

### Expected Result:
When printing from calendar view (monthly or weekly), it should print the actual calendar layout, not a list.

### Test Steps:
1. Navigate to Monthly Calendar View
2. Click the print button
3. In print preview, verify it shows calendar grid layout
4. Navigate to Weekly Calendar View
5. Click the print button
6. In print preview, verify it shows weekly calendar layout

## Summary

Both issues have been fixed:
1. ✅ Modal sizes are now consistent across all booking modals (max-w-4xl)
2. ✅ Calendar printing now properly prints calendar layouts instead of lists
